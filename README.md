## Contributions
- Structured categorization of existing work into three
topic clusters: LLMs for Generative Content Creation and
Manipulation, Embodied LLM Agents and LLM-powered
Assistive Systems.
- Comparative analysis of applications, technical implementations
and evaluation approaches within each cluster.
- Identification of benefits using LLMs in XR, as well
as common challenges and limitations currently faced by
research in this area.
- Derivation of further research directions considered
essential for the successful integration of LLMs into XR
systems.

## Abstract
Both Extended Reality (XR) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements in recent
years and are now widely adopted across various domains.
Integrating LLMs into XR leverages their capabilities in natural
language processing and reasoning to enable more intuitive
interaction, enhance user immersion, and improve accessibility.
To provide an overview of this emerging field, this review
analyzes a systematic selection of 36 studies published since
2023 in ACM and IEEE venues. These works are categorized
into three thematic clusters: LLMs for Generative Content
Creation and Manipulation, Embodied LLM Agents, and LLMpowered
Assistive Systems. Within each cluster, key approaches,
technologies, and results are examined and compared. Building
on this analysis, the review identifies cross-cutting challenges
related to latency, spatial understanding, evaluation practices,
and concerns related to privacy and ethics. For each of these
areas, specific directions for future research are proposed.
